# Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch

This module implements Multiple Linear Regression from scratch using NumPy,
without relying on high-level machine learning libraries for training.

## Overview
The goal is to understand how linear regression extends from one feature
to multiple features and how the model behaves in both visual and
higher-dimensional settings.

## What is Covered
- Implementation using the Normal Equation
- Regression plane visualization (2 input features)
- Model evaluation using R² score
- Generalization to higher-dimensional datasets

## Structure
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb` – main implementation
- `data/` – datasets used for training and evaluation

## Notes
Visualization is limited to two features.  
For datasets with more features, the model is evaluated numerically.
